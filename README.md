# courite-prerelease
All purpose Discord bot, developed by courier.
Many plans for commands, notably moderation / QOL commands, (ex: /**`afk`** = [AFK] usertag, auto updates, etc), and possibly an AI feature readily available, all on free servers. Courite will be free to add / use, with many future plans. Admins of servers / active developers have special privileges using the bot, such as running **inspect** commands, diagnostic commands, runtime, down-detection, etc. This is my dream project, and I hope to work on it often. As my first real step into programming, this may take a huge chunk of time to produce. Changelog will be published somewhere soon, but in the meantime you can submit suggestions, inquiries, and concerns, on my Discord: **`@laugh.track`**.
